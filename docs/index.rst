What is Sensaas?
====================================


.. image:: _static/alignement.png

**SENSAAS** is the result of a collaboration between researchers of two labs of `UCA (University CÃ´te d'Azur) <https://univ-cotedazur.fr/>`_: `I3S <https://www.i3s.unice.fr>`_ and `IPMC <https://www.ipmc.cnrs.fr/cgi-bin/site.cgi>`_. 
Based on the publication `SenSaaS: Shape-based Alignment by Registration of Colored Point-based Surfaces <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/minf.202000081>`_, **SENSAAS** is a shape-based alignment program which allows to superimpose molecules in 3D space.

Our algorithm runs with Python 3.7 and requires the `open3D library <http://www.open3d.org/>`_.

How does Sensaas work?
====================================

Considering two molecules named Source and Target as input, SENSAAS will propose a transformation matrix as output, that will will lead to the "best" alignement of Source on Target. SENSAAS  follows four major steps:

- generation of one point cloud of the molecular surface of the two input molecules; 
- coarse alignment of the two point clouds thanks to a geometry-aware registration; 
- labelling of each point of the two clouds according to several user-defined classes;
- refinement of this alignement by applying a color and geometry-aware local registration. At this step, for each point, a color is associated at each class.

**1. Generation of input point clouds** 
For each input file (Source and Target), a point cloud of the Van der Waal surface is obtained. Each point is described by its 3D coordinates, and a color (RGB) according to the nature of the underlying atom.

**2. Coarse alignment by global registration** At this step, the Source point cloud is globally superimposed on the Target, by finding the best matching in terms of
geometry only. The matching is done on local 3D descriptors computed on a limited number of points (rather than on the points themselves).

**2. Labelling of the points of each point cloud** Each point is colored according to its belonging to a user-defined class. In the current version, the classes depend on the pharmacophore features, but they can depend by any physico-chemical property mapped on the surface.

**4. Refinement of this first alignement by applying a color and geometry-aware registration** At this step the registration takes into account the geometry of the point clouds, but also the color of the points provided by the previous step of labelling. the coarse alignement is finally improved by finding the best matching between
the two colored point clouds. The method used here is the method presented in `Colored Point Cloud Registration Revisited <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8237287>`_.
This step results into a transformation matrix (rotation + translation), that is applied to the Source molecule to get the final alignement.

Information on the third-party program NSC
==========================================

NSC is used to efficiently generate point clouds of molecules and to calculate their surfaces. It is written in C and was developed by Frank Eisenhaber who kindly licensed its use in SENSAAS. **Please be advised that the use of NSC is strictly tied to SENSAAS and its code is released under the following** `license <https://github.com/SENSAAS/sensaas/blob/main/License_NSC.txt>`_. If the NSC license is an issue for your application or if you wish to use NSC independently of SENSAAS, please contact the author Frank Eisenhaber (email: `frank.eisenhaber@gmail.com <frank.eisenhaber@gmail.com>`_) who will amicably manage your request.

Executables nsc (for Linux) or ncs-win (for windows) are included in this repository. In case they do not work on your system, you may have to compile it using the source file nsc.c in directory src/

**for Windows:**

The current executable nsc-win.exe was compiled by using http://www.codeblocks.org. Rename the executable as nsc-win.exe because 'nsc-win.exe' is used to set the variable nscexe in the Python script sensaas.py

**for Linux**::

   cc src/nsc.c -lm

rename a.out as nsc because 'nsc' is used to set the variable nscexe in the Python script sensaas.py::

   cp a.out nsc

Run Sensaas
===========


This algorithm is used to optimize an alignment of 2 molecules or proteins. You can see results on `PyMol <https://pymol.org/2/>`_, if you don't own PyMol yet, click here: `Visualization`_.

.. warning:: Before using Sensaas, please check that your **inputs are 3D files**. The algorithm works only with **sdf/pdb/xyzrgb/pcd** 3D files. 

To align a Source molecule on a Target molecule, the syntax is:::
	
   python sensaas.py <target-type> <target-file-name> <source-type> <source-file-name> <output-file-name> <mode> (with the appropriate path)

**<target-type>**
   type of the target file (sdf/pdb/dot/xyzrgb/pcd)

**<target-file-name>**
   name of the target file (you need to precise the path of the target file)

**<source-type>**
   type of the source file (sdf/pdb/dot/xyzrgb/pcd)

**<source-file-name>**
   name of the source file (you need to precise the path of the source file)

**<output-file-name>**
   name of the output file that will be created. We usually named it "slog" but you can call it whatever you want. It details results of the alignement with final scores on the last line.

**<mode>** (optim or eval)
   \- "optim": generates a transformation matrix
   
   \- "eval": evaluate the alignment "in place" (without aligning)

When you will us SENSAAS, it will create **3 outputs files**: slog, Source_tran, tran.txt.

Example with sdf file
---------------------
::

   python sensaas.py sdf <target-file-name>.sdf sdf <source-file-name>.sdf slog.txt optim

Here the source file is aligned (moved) on the target file.

	the output tran.txt contains the transformation matrix allowing the alignment of the source file:

	    if Source input file is **sdf** then **Source_tran.sdf** is the transformed sdf source file

	    if Source input file is **pdb** then **Source_tran.pdb** is the transformed pdb source file

	    if Source input file is **dot** then **Source-dots_tran.pdb** is the transformed dot file in pdb format

 	    if Source input file is **xyzrgb** then **Source_tran.xyzrgb** is the transformed xyzrgb file

	    if Source input file is **pcd** then **Source_tran.pcd** is the transformed pcd file

**slog** (whatever you want to call it) details results with final scores on the last line.

.pcd or .xyzrgb file contains coordinates and rgb colors of points and can be read by Open3D (visualize.py in directory utils)

Example with IMATINIB.sdf
-------------------------

1. example (IMATINIB_mv.sdf was reoriented when compared with IMATINIB.sdf):

::

	(sensaas) > sensaas.py sdf DATASET/IMATINIB.sdf sdf DATASET/IMATINIB_mv.sdf slog.txt optim

Here, the source file IMATINIB_mv.sdf is aligned (**moved**) on the target file IMATINIB.sdf (**that does not move**). The output tran.txt contains the transformation matrix allowing the alignment of the source file (result in **Source_tran.sdf**). The slog.txt file details results with final scores on the last line. In this example, the last line must look like::

   gfit= 1.000 cfit= 0.999 hfit= 0.996 gfit+hfit= 1.996

There are three different fitness scores but we only use 2 of them, gfit and hfit, to calculate gfit+hfit.

   * gfit score estimates the geometric matching of point-based surfaces - it ranges between 0 and 1
   * hfit score estimates the matching of colored points representing pharmacophore features - it ranges between 0 and 1

Thus, we calculate a hybrid score = gfit + hfit scores - **gfit+hfit ranges between 0 and 2**

   * A gfit+hfit score close to 2.0 means a perfect superimposition.
   * A gfit+hfit score > 1.0 means that similaries were identified.

**(Option)** Here IMATINIB.sdf and IMATINIB_mv.sdf are the 2 same molecules thus, you can evaluate the RMSD value by using rdkit if installed (see optional packages above)::

   python utils/rdkit-CalcLigRMSD.py examples/IMATINIB.sdf Source_tran.sdf

Here, it returns RMSD= 0.00

2. example (IMATINIB_mv.sdf was reoriented when compared with IMATINIB.sdf)(with eval: To evaluate an alignment (in place)):

::

   (sensaas) > sensaas.py sdf DATASET/IMATINIB.sdf sdf DATASET/IMATINIB_mv.sdf slog eval

**slog** (whatever you want to call it) details results with final scores on the last line
